- 👋 Hi, I’m @servivo, a 28 year old PhD student in the field of political education, lecturer at the University and researcher. 👩‍🏫
- 👀 I’m interested in diversifying my skillset in order to continue working remotely so this is why I have started to learn programming languages. My other interests include travelling, photography and cooking. 😊 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, Css and JS. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me to solidify my newly acquired knowledge in these languages. Tell me how I can be of help and I will look into it.
- ⚒  My short-term goal is to develop and launch an app for my students which will help them during their internship. I have all the ideas and visualization of this app on my mind! Only the skills in Java/Koitlin are missing for the moment. Do you want to collaborate on this? 😉 
- 📫 Do you think I can help you or do you think you can help me? Just write me an e-mail: portugiesischlernen2013@gmail.com
