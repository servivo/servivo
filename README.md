- 👋 Hi, I’m @servivo, a 28 year old PhD student and researcher. :)
- 👀 I’m interested in diversifying my skillset in order to continue working remotely so this is why I have started to learn programming languages. My other interests include travelling, photography and cooking. 😊
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, Css and JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me to solidify my newly acquired knowledge in these languages. Tell me how I can be of help and I will look into it.
- 📫 How to reach me, just write me an e-mail: beatriz.matafora@uni-due.de
